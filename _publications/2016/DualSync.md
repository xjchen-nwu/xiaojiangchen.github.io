  The low-cost crystal oscillators embedded in wireless sensor nodes are prone to be affected by their working condition, leading to undesired variation of clock skew. To preserve synchronized clocks, nodes have to undergo frequent re-synchronization to cope with the time-varying clock skew, which in turn means excessive energy consumption. In this paper, we propose DualSync, a synchronization approach for low-power wireless networks under dynamic working condition. By utilizing time-stamp exchanges and local measurement of temperature and voltage, DualSync maintains an accurate clock model to closely trace the relationship between clock skew and the influencing factors. We further incorporate an error-driven mechanism to facilitate interplay between Inter-Sync and Self-Sync, so as to preserve high synchronization accuracy while minimizing communication cost. We evaluate the performance of DualSync across various scenarios and compare it with state-of-art approaches. The experimental results illustrate the superior performance of DualSync in terms of both accuracy and energy efficiency.
