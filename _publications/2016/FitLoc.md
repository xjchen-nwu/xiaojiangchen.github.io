  Device-free localization (DfL) techniques, which can localize targets without carrying any wireless devices, have attracting an increasing attentions. Most current DfL approaches, however, have two main drawbacks hindering their practical applications. First, one needs to collect large number of measurements to achieve a high localization accuracy, inevitably causing a high deployment cost, and the areas variety will further exacerbate this problem. Second, as the pre-obtained Received Signal Strength (RSS) from each location (i.e., radio-map) in a specific area cannot be directly applied to new areas for localization, the calibration process of different areas will lead to the high human effort cost. In this paper, we propose, FitLoc, a fine-grained and low cost DfL approach that can localize multiple targets in various areas. By taking advantage of the compressive sensing (CS) theory, FitLoc decreases the deployment cost by collecting only a few of RSS measurements and performs a fine-grained localization. Further, FitLoc employs a rigorously designed transfer scheme to unify the radio-map over various areas, thus greatly reduces the human effort cost. Theoretical analysis about the effectivity of the problem formulation is provided. Extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of FitLoc.
