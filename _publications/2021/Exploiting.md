  Operating in unlicensed ISM bands, ZigBee devices often yield poor performance due to the interference from ever increasing wireless devices in the 2.4 GHz band. Our empirical results show that, a specific interference is likely to have different influence on different outbound links of a ZigBee sender, which indicates the chance of concurrent transmissions. Based on this insight, we propose Smoggy-Link, a practical protocol to exploit the potential concurrency for adaptive ZigBee transmissions under harsh interference. Smoggy-Link maintains an accurate link model to quantify and trace the relationship between interference and link qualities of the sender's outbound links. With such a link model, Smoggy-Link can translate low-cost interference information to the fine-grained spatiotemporal link state. The link information is further utilized for adaptive link selection and intelligent transmission schedule. We implement and evaluate a prototype of our approach with TinyOS and TelosB motes. The evaluation results show that Smoggy-Link has consistent improvements in both throughput and packet reception ratio under interference from various interferers.
