  Pesticide overuse poses significant risks to human healthand environmental integrity. Addressing the limitations ofexisting approaches, which struggle with the diversity ofpesticide compounds, portability issues, and environmentalsensitivity, this paper introduces Hornbill. A wireless andbattery-free electrochemical bio-tag that integrates the advantages of NFC technology with electrochemical biosensorsfor portable, precise, and touchless multi-pesticide detection.The basic idea of Hornbill is comparing the distinct electrochemical responses between a pair of biological receptorsand different pesticides to construct a unique set of featurefingerprints to make multi-pesticide sensing feasible. To incorporate this idea within small NFC tags, we reengineer theelectrochemical sensor, spanning the antenna to the voltageregulator. Additionally, to improve the system’s sensitivityand environmental robustness, we carefully design the electrodes by combining microelectrode technology and materials science. Experiments with 9 different pesticides show thatHornbill achieves a mean accuracy of 93% in different concentration environments and its sensitivity and robustnesssurpass that of commercial electrochemical sensors.
