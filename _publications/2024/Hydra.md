 While Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have been shown to enhance OFDM communication performance, this paper unveils a potential security concern arising from widespread RIS deployment. Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities to hijack or deploy rogue RIS, transforming them from communication boosters into attackers. We present a novel attack that disrupts the critical orthogonality property of OFDM subcarriers, severely degrading communication performance. This attack is achieved by manipulating the RIS to generate frequency-shifted reflections/harmonics of the original OFDM signal. We also propose algorithms to simultaneously beamform the multiple RIS-generated frequency shifted reflections towards selected targets. Extensive experiments conducted in indoor, outdoor, 3D, and office settings demonstrate that Hydra can achieve a 90% throughput reduction in targeted attack scenarios and a 43% throughput reduction in indiscriminate attack scenarios. Furthermore, we validated the effectiveness of our attacks on both the 802.11 protocol and the 5G NR protocol.
