  Earphones are emerging as the most popular wearable devices and there has been a growing trend in bringing intelligence to earphones. Previous efforts include adding extra sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) or peripheral hardware to make earphones smart. These methods are usually complex in design and also incur additional cost. In this paper, we present Earmonitor, a low-cost system that uses the in-ear earphones to achieve sensing purposes. The basic idea behind Earmonitor is that each person's ear canal varies in size and shape. We therefore can extract the unique features from the ear canal-reflected signals to depict the personalized differences in ear canal geometry. Furthermore, we discover that the signal variations are also affected by the fine-grained physiological activities. We can therefore further detect the subtle heartbeat from the ear canal reflections. Experiments show that Earmonitor can achieve up to 96.4% Balanced Accuracy (BAC) and low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) for user identification on a large-scale data of 120 subjects. For heartbeat monitoring, without any training, we propose signal processing schemes to achieve high sensing accuracy even in the most challenging scenarios when the target is walking or running.
