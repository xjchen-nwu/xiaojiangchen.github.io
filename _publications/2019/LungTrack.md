  Respiration rate sensing plays a critical role in elderly care and patient monitoring. The latest research has explored the possibility of employing Wi-Fi signals for respiration sensing without attaching a device to the target. A critical issue with these solutions includes that good monitoring performance could only be achieved at certain locations within the sensing range, while the performance could be quite poor at other "dead zones." In addition, due to the contactless nature, it is challenging to monitor multiple targets simultaneously as the reflected signals are often mixed together. In this work, we present our system, named LungTrack, hosted on commodity RFID devices for respiration monitoring. Our system retrieves subtle signal fluctuations at the receiver caused by chest displacement during respiration without need for attaching any devices to the target. It addresses the dead-zone issue and enables simultaneous monitoring of two human targets by employing one RFID reader and carefully positioned multiple RFID tags, using an optimization technique. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LungTrack can achieve a respiration monitoring accuracy of greater than 98% for a single target at all sensing locations (within 1st -- 5th Fresnel zones) using just one RFID reader and five tags, when the target's orientation is known a priori. For the challenging scenario involve two human targets, LungTrack is able to achieve greater than 93% accuracy when the targets are separated by at least 10 cm.
