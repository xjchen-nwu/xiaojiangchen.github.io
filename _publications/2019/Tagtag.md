  Material sensing is an essential ingredient for many IoT applications. While hyperspectral camera, infrared, X-Ray, and Radar provide potential solutions for material identification, high cost is the major concern limiting their applications. In this paper, we explore the capability of employing RF signals for fine-grained material sensing with commodity RFID device. The key reason for our system to work is that the tag antenna's impedance is changed when it is close or attached to a target. The amount of impedance change is dependent on the target's material type, thus enabling us to utilize the impedance-related phase change available at commodity RFID devices for material sensing. Several key challenges are addressed before we turn the idea into a functional system: (i) the random tag-reader distance causes an additional unknown phase change on top of the phase change caused by the target material; (ii) the tag rotations cause phase shifts and (iii) for conductive liquid, there exists liquid reflection which interferes with the impedance-caused phase change. We address these challenges with novel solutions. Comprehensive experiments show high identification accuracies even for very similar materials such as Pepsi and Coke.
