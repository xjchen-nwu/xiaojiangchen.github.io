  Target material identification is playing an important role in our everyday life. Traditional camera and video-based methods bring in severe privacy concerns. In the last few years, while RF signals have been exploited for indoor localization, gesture recognition and motion tracking, very little attention has been paid in material identification. This paper introduces WiMi, a device-free target material identification system, implemented on ubiquitous and cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. The intuition is that different materials produce different amounts of phase and amplitude changes when a target appears on the line-of-sight (LoS) of a radio frequency (RF) link. However, due to multipath and hardware imperfection, the measured phase and amplitude of the channel state information (CSI) are very noisy. We thus present novel CSI pre-processing schemes to address the multipath and hardware noise issues before they can be used for accurate material sensing. We also design a new material feature which is only related to the material type and is independent of the target size. Comprehensive real-life experiments demonstrate that WiMi can achieve fine-grained material identification with cheap commodity Wi-Fi devices. WiMi can identify 10 commonly seen liquids at an overall accuracy higher than 95% with strong multipath indoors. Even for very similar items such as Pepsi and Coke, WiMi can still differentiate them at a high accuracy.
